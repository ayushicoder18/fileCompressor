# fileCompressor
Used sharp as a module for Nodejs to convert images of different formats and dimensions to smaller size without compromising with the quality of the picture

I used multer as a middleware for handling form data that is mainly used to upload files, by combining it with express.js I was able to easily implement the file upload feature.
